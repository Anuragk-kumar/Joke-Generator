How it Works
The app uses a custom hook, useFetch, to fetch jokes from the Chuck Norris API.
The hook handles the loading and error states and returns the joke data and a function to fetch new jokes.
When the app loads, it fetches a joke and displays it.
Clicking the "New Joke" button triggers the fetch function to get a new joke and display it.
